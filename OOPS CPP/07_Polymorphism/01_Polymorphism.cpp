/***************************************Polymorphism********************************************
 * Polymorphism is considered one of teh important features of Object-Oriented Programming.
 * Polymorphism is a concept that allows you to perform a single action in different ways.
 * Polymorphism is the combination of two Greek Words. The Poly Means many and morphs means forms.
 * so polymorphism means many forms. Let's understand polymorphism with a real-life example.
 * 
 * REAL LIFE EXAMPLE :-  A person at the same time can have different characteristics. Like a man 
 * at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person possesses different behavior
 * in different situations. This is called polymorphism.
 * 
 * Types of polymorphism :-
